# Authentication-via-Phno

Here I have created simple login page in Android Studio where we have to enter mobile number and it will send opt on that number. Once we enter correct otp it will redirect to the dashboared.

I have used FIREBASE TECHNOLOGY to make it work. Also, the entered mobile number will be stored in firebase database.
